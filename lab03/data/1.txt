My name is Kira Yoshikage. I am 33 years old. My house is located in the northeastern part of Morio, in the estate area. I work at the office of the Kame Yu chain of stores and return home at eight o'clock at the latest. I don't smoke, I drink occasionally. I go to bed at 11 p.m. and make sure that I get exactly eight hours of sleep, no matter what. Before going to bed, I drink warm milk, and also spend twenty minutes warming up, so I sleep until morning without any problems. I wake up in the morning feeling neither tired nor stressed, like a baby. I was told at the medical check-up that there were no problems. I'm trying to convey that I'm an ordinary person who wants to live a quiet life. I don't worry about problems like winning or losing, and I don't make enemies that keep me awake. I know for sure that happiness lies in this way of interacting with society. Although, if I had to fight, I wouldn't lose to anyone.
